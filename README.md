# SocialNetworkGrapher
The program consists of modeling a social network between twitter users via reading and processing individual tweets from the users. Essentially if one user has mentioned two other users in their tweet, the program would model the relationship between users with blocks with the users name and lines connecting the two users.  

The program takes the tweets of individual users in the form of a text file and scans each individual tweet searching for any mention of another user. Once all tweets are read and the relationships between users are saved, the program models the relationships and saves the model to a new JPEG.
